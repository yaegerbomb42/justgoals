# 100% Free Backend Notification Alternatives

Since Cloud Functions requires a paid plan, here are completely free alternatives for background notifications:

## Option 1: GitHub Actions (RECOMMENDED)
**Cost: 100% Free** - 2,000 minutes/month on public repos, 500 minutes/month on private repos

### How it works:
1. Store user notification preferences in Firestore (free tier)
2. GitHub Action runs every hour to check for scheduled notifications
3. Sends ntfy notifications directly from GitHub's servers

### Setup:
Create `.github/workflows/notifications.yml`:

```yaml
name: Background Notifications
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'  # Every hour
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger

jobs:
  send-notifications:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Send Scheduled Notifications
        run: |
          # Fetch users from Firestore and send notifications
          node -e "
          const https = require('https');
          
          // Your notification logic here
          // This runs on GitHub's servers for free
          "
```

## Option 2: Vercel Cron Jobs (RECOMMENDED)
**Cost: 100% Free** - Hobby plan includes cron jobs

### How it works:
1. Deploy your app to Vercel (free)
2. Create API route for notifications
3. Use Vercel's cron jobs to trigger hourly

### Setup:
Create `api/cron-notifications.js`:

```javascript
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  // Check authorization
  if (req.headers.authorization !== `Bearer ${process.env.CRON_SECRET}`) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  }
  
  // Your notification logic here
  // Fetch from Firestore, send to ntfy
  
  res.json({ success: true });
}
```

Add to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/cron-notifications",
    "schedule": "0 * * * *"
  }]
}
```

## Option 3: Railway.app (FREE)
**Cost: 100% Free** - $5 credit monthly, simple apps use ~$1/month

### How it works:
1. Deploy a simple Node.js service to Railway
2. Service runs 24/7 checking for notifications
3. Uses minimal resources (well within free tier)

## Option 4: Fly.io (FREE)
**Cost: 100% Free** - Generous free tier for small apps

### How it works:
1. Deploy lightweight notification service
2. Runs in background checking Firestore
3. Sends notifications via ntfy

## Option 5: Browser Extension + Background Script
**Cost: 100% Free** - No server needed

### How it works:
1. Create a simple browser extension
2. Extension runs background script even when browser closed*
3. Checks for notifications locally

*Note: Modern browsers limit background scripts, but still possible for short periods

## Option 6: Desktop App with Background Service
**Cost: 100% Free** - Runs locally

### How it works:
1. Convert your web app to Electron app (you already have electron setup!)
2. Electron can run background processes
3. App runs in system tray checking for notifications
