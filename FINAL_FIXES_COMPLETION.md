**Problem**: Audio errors and insufficient fallback mechanisms
**Root Cause**: Limited error handling and single-path audio loading
**Solution**:
- Enhanced sound availability detection with multiple test methods
- Implemented fallback URL system for each sound type
- Added comprehensive error handling for all audio states
- Implemented cross-sound fallback system (if rain fails, try forest, etc.)
- Enhanced autoplay policy compliance with multiple interaction types
- Added proper timeout handling for network requests
- Improved audio loading with better preload and error recovery
- Added volume adjustment isolation to prevent conflicts

**Files Modified:**
